abstract="Web content nowadays can also be accessed through new generation of Internet connected TVs. However, these products failed to change users' behavior when consuming online content. Users still prefer personal computers to access Web content. Certainly, most of the online content is still designed to be accessed by personal computers or mobile devices. In order to overcome the usability problem of Web content consumption on TVs, this paper presents a knowledge graph based video generation system that automatically converts textual Web content into videos using semantic Web and computer graphics based technologies. As a use case, Wikipedia articles are automatically converted into videos. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated empirically via opinion surveys. Fifty percent of survey users indicated that they found generated videos enjoyable and 42 {\%} of them indicated that they would like to use our system to consume Web content on their TVs.",
